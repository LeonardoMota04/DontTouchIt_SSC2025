# "Don’t Touch It" - WWDC 2025 Swift Student Challenge Winner Submission
Don’t Touch It is an immersive experience that blends the real and digital worlds through touchless interactions. Using head tracking and hand gestures, users experience how current technologies enable new forms of interaction, with a cube symbolizing how we stay present in the real world while immersed in the virtual.

# Technology & Frameworks used
- UIKit: for cube and camera manipulation, scene setup, lights, and configuration.
- SceneKit: for creating the 3D cube programmatically.
- AVFoundation: for capturing and manipulating the front camera feed.
- Combine: for managing real-time data streams, including hand gestures and head tracking.
- Vision: for detecting points on the user's face to track the distance from the center of the screen.
- CreateML: to train and process 1-second video clips for generating hand action recognition models, leveraging the new Hand Action technology.
- CoreML: for processing and managing gestures within the app.
- SwiftUI: for building the interface and managing app-wide data and states.

# The story behind it
As a graduate of the Apple Developer Academy in Brasília, Brazil, I’ve always been passionate about creating experiences that bridge the gap between the real and digital worlds. My journey with Rubik's cubes began years ago as a mental escape and has since become a stress reliever and a hobby that pushes me to think in unique ways. This scene is inspired by the Rubik’s cube, which stands as a symbol of mental challenge and creativity.
The inspiration for Don’t Touch It came from observing the way society is increasingly becoming virtual, yet we remain tethered to the real world. This scene invites users to experience the best of both worlds: staying grounded in reality while interacting with a virtual object through natural body movements. The cube’s interactivity allows users to experience a sense of connection with the environment, demonstrating how we can leverage technology without losing touch with the real world.
